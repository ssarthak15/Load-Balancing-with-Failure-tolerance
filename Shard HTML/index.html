      <h2> What is this?</h2>
      <h3 id="welcome"> Introduction</h3>
      
      <p> This program is a loadbalancing server. It uses sharding and replication to improve robustness of the storage service. The 
	  system shares key ideas in its design with some of the online storage/file sharing 
	  systems.</p>
	  
	  <p>In this storage system, the client may partition the data it needs to upload into 
		a number of partitions (e.g., 3 in this project) and upload it to three different 
		serverswhich we call these shards. </p>
		
		<p>In this project, we will have each shard split the data it receives for storage into
		two pieces and copy them to the remaining two servers. That way, if a shard crashes,
		we have a copy of the data on the two remaining servers. The system will not be able 
		to recover if more than one shard crashes.</p>
		
		<p>The clients and the shards require several configuration parameters which are specified
		in a configuration file. The configuration file uses a JSON format and allows these keys:</p>
	  
      <pre class="prettyprint">      homedir: home directory for the shard and client. Each client
      and shard has a different home directory.

      listenport: port at which this shard should listen for
      incoming connections.

      metadatafile: the file that stores the metadata corresponding to
      the files and replicates stored by the shard.

      shard1ip: IP address of shard 1. Client and shard use this
      information.

      shard1port: Port of shard 1. Client and shard use this
      information.

      shard2ip: IP address of shard 2. Client and shard use this
      information.

      shard2port: Port of shard 2. Client and shard use this
      information.

      shard3ip: IP address of shard 3. Client uses this information.

      shard3port: Port of shard 3. Client uses this information.</pre>

      <h3 id="benefits"> Client</h3>
      <p>The client is a socket program that interacts with the shards to determine how much 
		data to upload to each shard. Then it uploads the appropriate amount of data to the 
		shards. The client tries to balance the total amount of storage utilized on the shards. 
		For example, if shard1 happens to store more data than shard2 and shard3, the client 
		will upload more data to shard1 than shard2 and shard3. Ideally, shards 1, 2, and 3 will 
		have exactly the same amount of data after each upload but that will never be the case 
		because of how the shards are replicated but we will try to get as close to balanced 
		storage as possible.</p>
      
      <h3 id="features"> Shard</h3>
      <p>Shard is responsible for storing the files. For simplification, shards will also be the 
		backups and develop the system so that it can tolerate the failure of one shard. Further, 
		the system will support exactly three shards but the IP address and ports are not hard 
		coded in the code. Each shard connects to the other two shards, shard1 and shard2.</p>
		
		<p>The shards, when they receive an upload file, they split the file into two equal parts 
		and upload the "backup" to the other two shards. Thus each upload chunk is tagged as 
		primary or backup on the shard. When calculating the total storage used on a shard, it 
		reports the total of primary and backup storage.</p>

		<p>The shard listens to the incoming connections from the clients. It also connects to the 
		other shards in the network. It keeps a metadata of all the uploaded files and replicated 
		files as backup.</p>
		
      <h3 id="license"> Shard metadata</h3>
      <p>The home directory for the shard contains a metadata file specified in the configuration 
		file. The metadata has information about the primary and backup data stored by the shard. 
		This file must be in JSON format but you are welcome to come up with your own list of 
		fields as needed by your shards to operate correctly and efficiencly..</p>
      <hr>

      <h3 id="view_type"> Shard Details</h3>
      <p>The shard uses a load balancing algorithm which is explained below. The algorithm is used only when a client 
	  uplooads a file to the server. </p>
     


      <h3 id="animation_style"> The Load Balancing Algorithm</h3>
      <p>This is a custom algorithm thatwas designed specifically for this project. In this 
		algorithm it has been assumed that shards might different number of bytes initially. 
		Irrespective of how huge the difference is the Algorithm will still give 2 Bytes of 
		the file to every shard. </p>
		<p>After every shard has been alloted 2 bytes of data,  the shard which has the least 
		load will get the 1 byte.</p>
		<p>This process will repeat itself until all shards are balanced.</p>

      <h3 id="bars_text"> Example</h3>
      <pre>
Assume:
Shard1: 100 Bytes 			Shard2: 500 Bytes  			Shard3: 500 Bytes
and we have to upload a file of 100 Bytes

In this case first all shards will get 2 Bytes of data.
Shard1: 102 Bytes 			Shard2: 502 Bytes  			Shard3: 502 Bytes

Now, smallest shard will get next byte:
Shard1: 103 Bytes 			Shard2: 502 Bytes  			Shard3: 502 Bytes

This will be repeated until balance is achieved or upload is complete. For this example:
Shard1: 196 Bytes 			Shard2: 502 Bytes  			Shard3: 502 Bytes
   </pre>
   
   <h3 id="added_funnctionality"> Added function</h3>
   
   <pre>
A new function has been added. If the client want he can delete all the files on the server, i.e. on all shards.
A client can use this function simply by using the following command:</pre>
<pre class="prettyprint"><big>python client.py -config configfile.json -eraseall
</pre>
